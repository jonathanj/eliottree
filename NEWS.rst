Eliottree 19.0.1 (2020-01-15)
=============================

The public API for `render_tasks` was broken unnecessarily in 19.0.0, this
release replaces the `colorize` keyword argument and deprecates it instead.


Eliottree 19.0.0 (2020-01-14)
=============================

Features
--------

- Tree lines are now colored to help differentiate nested tasks, action tasks that have failed are also colored distinctly; `--no-color-tree` will disable tree line colors. (#76)
- An alternative color theme is now provided for light themed terminals, the `COLORFGBG` environment variable is used to try detect this but can be set explicitly with `--theme light`. (#78)
- Timestamps can now be displayed in local time with `--local-timezone`. (#79)
- Unicode and color output is now supported on Windows. (#82)
- Colorize tree lines by default, use `--no-color-tree` to disable the feature. Tree lines normally cycle through several colors, however the lines of failed actions will be colored in a way that differentiates them. (#87)
- It is now possible to configure eliottree's defaults via a config file, as well as override the color theme. Use `--show-default-config` to create a base config. (#88)


Bugfixes
